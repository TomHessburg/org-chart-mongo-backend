# org-shart-mongo-backend

> Spent the last few days teaching myself MongoDB! Wanted to give myself the opportunity to build something with it, so I decided to take a project which I was a Team Lead on for Lambda School build weeks and create a new backend for it with Node, Express, and MongoDB! Also planning to implement a Redis cache and get this thing hosted on AWS just to stretch my abilities!
