# org-shart-mongo-backend

> Spent the last several days teaching myself MongoDB and Redis Caching! Wanted to give myself the opportunity to build something with it, so I decided to take a project which I had been a Team Lead on (for Lambda School build weeks) and create a new backend for it with Node, Express, Redis, and MongoDB!
